* dwm status
simple modular dwm status command made in go that has drop in plugins that u can arrange the ordering of and/or remove from plugins/plugins.go

** usage
edit ~plugins/plugins.go~ to change what is used/what order it is used in
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  package plugins

  import (
    _ "dwmstatus/plugins/uptime"
    _ "dwmstatus/plugins/cpu"
    _ "dwmstatus/plugins/memory"
    _ "dwmstatus/plugins/time"
    _ "dwmstatus/plugins/date"
    _ "dwmstatus/plugins/battery"
  )
#+END_SRC
this would be ~uptime | cpu | memory | time | date | battery~
simply moving one of those in the list dictates where it will end up in the list
like moving cpu up 1 would make it ~cpu | uptime | memory | ...~

then all you do is ~go build~ and copy the binary to ur ~PATH~ and ur good to just run it and have fun
